Experimental Design

1. conceptual design/ pedagogical view
2. system design
3. UI view [standard]
4. Code[AI cursor]

data structure for kernel (producer consumer)

piping

wc recursive

traversals on code

linked lists

examples:
\*where is producer consumer used in OS?

\*concurrency, why? Create a scenario.

\*Show concurrency. Absesne of locks. Where something breaks.

Things to be done before starting the 4th Experiment :

--Lab testing on all for factors first 3 exp.
--Pilot study without collecting data.
--build the infrastructue for data collection.
--logistics.
--designing the data format.
--Data collection. Backend.
--grading mechanism(assignment).

Need to learn about Experimental Design.
